General:
  * Fix TODOs in the code

  * We have three things where Items can be located:
    - Tile (World)
    - Equipment (Player, GameEngine)
    - Container (ContainerManager, GameEngine)

    All these have canAddItem, addItem and removeItem.
    addItem and removeItem should return success/failure (bool),
    so that we do not duplicate or make Items disappear.

  * All three "containers" (Tile, Equipment, Container)
    should work with and hold 'const Thing*'s. Equipment and
    Container should reject Creature Things.

    Actual Item objects are owned and managed by ItemManager
    Actual Creature objects are owned and managed by... GameEngine?

  * Add namespaces to each module

ContainerManager:
  * Add support for weight calculation

Protocol:
  * Put protocol.cc/.h back in GameEngine
  * Split helper into something like
    - PacketWriterServer
    - PacketWriterClient
    - PacketReaderServer
    - PacketReaderClient
  * Or perhaps put Packet*Server in GameEngine, Packet*Client in wsclient
    and just remove protocol?
