General:
  * Fix TODOs in the code

  * We have three things where Items can be located:
    - Tile (World)
    - Equipment (Player, GameEngine)
    - Container (ContainerManager, GameEngine)

    All these have canAddItem, addItem and removeItem.
    addItem and removeItem should return success/failure (bool),
    so that we do not duplicate or make Items disappear.

  * All three "containers" (Tile, Equipment, Container)
    should work with and hold 'const Thing*'s. Equipment and
    Container should reject Creature Things.

    Actual Item objects are owned and managed by ItemManager
    Actual Creature objects are owned and managed by... GameEngine?

  * Common data reader (new module io) for server and wsclient

  * Make /debug print full itemtype data, even unknown fields

ContainerManager:
  * Add support for weight calculation
