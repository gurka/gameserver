General:
  * Fix TODOs in the code

  * We have three things where Items can be located:
    - Tile (World)
    - Equipment (Player, GameEngine)
    - Container (ContainerManager, GameEngine)

    All these have canAddItem, addItem and removeItem.
    addItem and removeItem should return success/failure (bool),
    so that we do not duplicate or make Items disappear.

ContainerManager:
  * Add support for moving container items (might need to update rootItemPosition and parentContainerId)

  * Add support for weight calculation

  * Fix TODOs

  * Fix tests

  * PRIO:
    - GamePosition type CONTAINER is broken.
    - clientContainerId belongs to a player, but ItemPosition is set to Container::rootItemPosition
      (note: this can never happen, rootItemPosition is always inventory or world...)
    - Printing GamePosition sucks
    - Investigate moving clientContianerId stuff to Protocol
    - NO CLIENTCONTAINERID SHOULD EVER LEAVE PROTOCOL_71
      Only newContainerId for when using items that could be a container
    - GamePosition should use ItemUniqueId and containerSlot for Type::CONTAINER

World:
  * Look at how Tile stores Creatures (using CreatureId)
    Why not store them as Creature pointers, just like Items?
