General:
  * Fix TODOs in the code

  * We have three things where Items can be located:
    - Tile (World)
    - Equipment (Player, GameEngine)
    - Container (ContainerManager, GameEngine)

    All these have canAddItem, addItem and removeItem.
    addItem and removeItem should return success/failure (bool),
    so that we do not duplicate or make Items disappear.

ContainerManager:
  * Add support for moving container items (might need to update rootItemPosition and parentContainerId)

  * Add support for weight calculation

  * Fix TODOs

  * Fix tests

World:
  * Look at how Tile stores Creatures (using CreatureId)
    Why not store them as Creature pointers, just like Items?
