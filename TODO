General:
  * Fix TODOs in the code

  * We have three things where Items can be located:
    - Tile (World)
    - Equipment (Player, GameEngine)
    - Container (ContainerManager, GameEngine)

    All these have canAddItem, addItem and removeItem.
    addItem and removeItem should return success/failure (bool),
    so that we do not duplicate or make Items disappear.

  * All three "containers" (Tile, Equipment, Container)
    should work with and hold 'const Thing*'s. Equipment and
    Container should reject Creature Things.

    Actual Item objects are owned and managed by ItemManager
    Actual Creature objects are owned and managed by... GameEngine?

  * Find more good warning flags to enable

ContainerManager:
  * Add support for weight calculation

WSClient:
  * Use global position for xdiv,ydiv
  * Add chat/message box and input field/button to send
  * Add arrow key handling to move creature

Docker:
  * Troubleshoot emscripten cache issue (always downloading SDL lib)
  * Create docker image(s) with make target
  * (non-Docker): see if we can merge regular and wsclient cmake config
    and just skip wsclient if emscripten is not available

Split:
  * Update namespace in moved files
  * Implement utils::Tick for emscripten
  * Merge utils and common? data_loader does not fit in neither right now
  * Update project() in all CMakeLists.txt?
  * Fix unittests, own module?
