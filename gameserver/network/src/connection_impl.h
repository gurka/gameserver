/**
 * class ConnectionImpl
 *
 * Callbacks:
 *   on_packet_received:   called when a packet has been received
 *
 *   on_disconnected:     called when the connection is closed and
 *                       this instance is ready for deletion
 *
 * There are three ways a connection can be closed:
 *   1. Owner asks to close the connection gracefully, using close(force=false).
 *
 *      Any queued packets will be sent before the connection is closed.
 *
 *      When all queued packets have been sent and the socket is closed the
 *      on_disconnected callback is called.
 *
 *      If there are no queued packets to send the on_disconnected callback
 *      is called either in the same context or in a later context, depending on
 *      if there are any send or receive calls in progress.
 *
 *      No more packets are received after the call to close().
 *
 *   2. Owner asks to close the connection forcefully, using close(force=true).
 *
 *      The socket is closed and any queued packets to send are lost. The
 *      on_disconnected callback is called, either in the same context or in
 *      a later context, depending on if there are any send or receive calls
 *      in progress.
 *
 *      No more packets are received after the call to close().
 *
 *   3. An error occurs in a send or receive call.
 *
 *      The on_disconnected callback is called as soon as there is no send and
 *      no receive call in progress.
 *
 * Connection handles its receive loop itself, which is started in its constructor:
 *   1. receivePacket()
 *   2. receivePacket lambda
 *   3. onPacketHeaderReceived()
 *   4. onPacketHeaderReceived lambda
 *   5. onPacketDataReceived()
 *
